Task 1: If you noticed that there are total 90 sub directories in the directory '2023' of this repository. What did you think, how did I create 90 directories. Manually one by one or using a script, or a command ?

All 90 directories within seconds using a simple command.

 mkdir day{1..90}

Tasks
You have to do the same using Shell Script i.e using either Loops or command with start day and end day variables using arguments

make sure you provide permission to execute this file.
